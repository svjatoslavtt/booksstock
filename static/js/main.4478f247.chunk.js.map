Он серьезный физик-исследователь и один из самых известных в мире популяризаторов науки, с работами которого российский читатель только начинает знакомиться. Уже подзаголовок его книги подчеркивает, что нарисованная наукой картина мира превзошла по величественности все религиозные эпосы. Это грандиозное повествование разворачивается у Краусса в двух планах: как эволюция Вселенной, которая в итоге привела к нашему существованию, и как эволюция нашего понимания устройства этой Вселенной. Через всю книгу проходит метафора Платоновой пещеры: шаг за шагом наука вскрывает иллюзии и движется к подлинной реальности, лежащей в основе нашего мира. Путеводной нитью у Краусса служит свет — не только свет разума, но и само излучение, свойства которого удивительным образом переосмысляются на всех этапах развития науки — от механики через теорию электромагнитных волн к теории относительности, квантовой электродинамике, физике элементарных частиц и современной космологии.`,\n\t\tprice: 420,\n\t\tunsalePrice: 550,\n\t\tbadge: 'бестселлер',\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\tid: '2',\n\t\tsale: 12,\n\t\timage: require('../../../static/images/book-image2.webp'),\n\t\tname: 'Кладбище домашних животных',\n\t\tyear: 2020,\n\t\tauthor: 'Кинг Стивен',\n\t\tdescription: `Роман, который сам Кинг, считая \"слишком страшным\", долго не хотел отдавать в печать, но только за первый год было продано 657 000 экземпляров!
